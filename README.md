Campus Even reporting system

Hi! I made a website for my college! This is my project for WebKnot company.

What it does

Students can see fun events at college like hackathons and workshops and parties. They can say they want to come by typing their name and email. After the event they can say if it was good or bad.

Teachers and admin people can make new events and see who wants to come. They can also see who actually came to the event and make reports.

How to use it

For students:
Go to events page to see all the fun stuff
Click register button and type your info to join
Click feedback button after event to say if you liked it
Look at reports to see cool numbers

For teachers:
Click admin button and type the secret password admin123456  
Make new events by filling the form
See lists of students who signed up
Mark which students actually showed up

How to make it work on your computer

Easy way with Docker:
Get Docker program first
Type this: docker-compose up -d
Open your web browser
Go to localhost:4000

Normal way:
Get Node.js program first  
Type this: git clone https://github.com/Ashish7889/Campus-Event-Reporting.git
Type this: cd Campus-Event-Reporting
Type this: npm install
Type this: npm start
Open your web browser
Go to localhost:4000

What I used to build it

Node.js to make the server work
Express to handle web requests
SQLite database to remember everything
HTML to make web pages
CSS to make it look pretty
JavaScript to make buttons do things

Colors I picked

Cream color for backgrounds because it looks nice
Red color for important buttons so people notice them
Gray color for text so its easy to read
Light brown color for borders to separate things
White color for clean areas

Where you can put it on internet

Railway website
Render website  
Google Cloud
Heroku website
Any place that can run Docker

If something breaks

Make sure Docker is running
Check if internet is working
Try refreshing the page
Ask someone who knows computers
Look at error messages

Database stuff

I use SQLite database which is just one file
It remembers all events and students and feedback
No need to install big database programs
Everything is saved in database.db file

Secret admin password

The password for admin login is admin123456
Only teachers should know this
Students should not use admin section

This is my WebKnot company assignment and I worked really hard on it. I hope you like my college event website!
